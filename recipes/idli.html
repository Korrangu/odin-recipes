        <p>The delectable South Indian rice cake is a common breakfast in that region 
            of the country.It's really simple to make, but requires some patience and 
            love to make it right. Let's take a look at it</p>
<h2> Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Black lentils (without the skin) - 1 cup</li>
    <li>Idli Rice (Boiled Rice) - 4 cups</li>
    <li>Salt - to taste</li>
    <li>Ghee/butter/oil (for greasing)</li>
    <li>Love</li>
    <li>Patience</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now that we have all those things, what's the equipment needed to make this? Let's 
        quickly run through that too. Here's what you will need:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A utensil to soak your seeds in</li>
        <li>A grinder or a blender (a wet grinder is the best recommendation)</li>
        <li>A steamer or a pressure cooker</li>
        <li>Idli moulds/plates </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now we have those too, let's begin.</p>
    <h2>The process</h2>
    <p>The process starts the night before. Here's an order of the steps.
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the lentils and rice spearately for 6-8 hours</li>
            <li>Grind each of those into a fine paste, separately while making sure it's not 
                too runny/watery            </li>
            <li>mix those two batters together and add some salt</li>
            <li>Get the steamer going</li>
            <li>Grease the moulds/plates and put some batter in it</li>
            <li>Steam the batter for 7-9 minutes</li>
            <li>Remember, you only steam it. don't pressure cook it.</li>
            <li>If using a pressure cooker, don't put the weight/whistle on top and let the steam flow</li>
            <li>pull em out and eat em hot!</li>

        </ol>
